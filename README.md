# Twitter Metrics and Political outcomes


These notebooks are the outcome of a study done during the Fall quarter 2014 Python for Data Science class taught 
by Brian Grainger at Santa Clara University. The project was carried out by Mudra Patel, Joe Scannura, Fatima Ahtisham, 
and Xuan Tran. 

We studied Mayors and Governors who used twitter to communicate with their constituents during the last 3 years. Specifically 
we studied the candidates twitter accounts for 30 days before their election day and gathered information about how many 
followers they had, tweets they sent, likes and retweets they received, and the lexical diversity of these tweets. We then
looked to see if these were important variables to the outcome of the election they were involved in. From this we determined 
that only the number of followers, avg. number of tweets, and avg. number of likes received per tweet were significant variables. 
We found that these variables were distinct between Republicans and Democrats and lead to different outcomes for candidates
in the different parties.
